    #Adds a student to an empty hash + name?
    roster[grade] ||= []
    #What the heck did ||= (or equals) do in this case?
    #Rubyâ€™s ||= operator is a handy way to assign variables if they are not defined yet, but not change the variable if they are already defined. (so we can have grade as an argument passed through that's defined by the user, or grade can equal an empty [] array?)  this needs some extra help.
    #What is the local var roster doing? It's adding a new key to the hash as a placeholder so we can then add the student name into the array of names.
    roster[grade] << student
