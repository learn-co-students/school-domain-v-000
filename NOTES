If the roster already has a key of grade 9,
we'll be able to push 'name' into the array that the grade 9 key points to.
Otherwise, we'll need to first create the key of grade 9 and point it to an empty array.

However, if we're in the scenario in which the grade 9 key already exists,
we will erase its current contents by creating a key of 9 and setting it equal to an empty array!

# if roster has the grade key (grade 9)
if roster.key?(grade)
  # push the student 'name' into the array with the key of 9
  @grades[grade] << name
else
  # create a whole new grade(grade is a key)
  @grades[grade] = []
  # add a student 'name' into that new array with
  # the new key which is a new grade
  @grades[grade] << name
end
